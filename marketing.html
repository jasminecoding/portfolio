      <p>
        What is marketing? Marketing is about meeting the needs and wants of
        customers; Marketing is a business-wide function – it is not something
        that operates alone from other business activities. Marketing is about
        understanding customers and finding ways to provide products or services
        which customers demand. Marketing sits at the intersection of the
        business and the customer – the great arbiter of the self interests of
        the business and the needs of the buyer. There are several types and
        sub-types of marketing, digital and offline. You should determine and
        pursue the ones that work best for you.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the steps to a successful marketing plan?</h2>
      <h3>1. Conducting Situational Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to do when developing your digital marketing
        plan is to carry out an internal and external analysis (SWOT analysis)
        of the firm. A useful framework for this is the SWOT analysis that
        allows you to look at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
        weaknesses for your company and the market at large. You need to be
        familiar with the ecosystem you operate in, what your customers’ needs
        are, and where they get addressed. This analysis is equally qualitative
        as it is quantitative through looking at factors such as digital habits,
        intermediaries, influencers, and more.

        <br />
        Implementing benchmarking techniques that aim to identify the best
        digital practices and applying them to the business is an increasingly
        prominent part of the overall corporate strategy. You also need to
        conduct an internal study to know what your company’s situation is like
        in the digital age: is your website customer-oriented? How is the
        usability and browsing experience? Do you update your blog periodically?
        What is your website’s current positioning? And what is your social
        media presence?
      </p>
      <h3>2. Establish Digital Marketing Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have your place in the market and your strong points in mind,
        work on establishing some goals to have a clear idea of where your
        actions should take you. Everything you plan has to work towards meeting
        those goals. You can work on developing this part of your digital
        marketing plan with the SMART goals framework in mind: specific,
        measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely goals.
        <br />
        Here’s an example:
        <br />

        <strong>Not a SMART objective:</strong>
        “I want to increase the number of visits to my website.”
        <br /><strong>SMART objective:</strong>
        “I want to reach 20,000 visits a month on my website every month within
        three months. To do so, I’m going to do X, Y, and Z.”
      </p>

      <h3>3. Define the marketing strategy</h3>
      <p>
        Once you’ve defined your business objectives, what are you going to do
        to achieve them? Personalization is becoming increasingly important in
        digital marketing. When it comes to defining your strategy for carrying
        out your plan, keep these factors in mind:
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>– Segmenting your target audience:</strong> Know who you want to
        address, what their tastes, needs, or preferences are, where are you
        looking to meet their expectations, etc. This is the time to create your
        buyer persona.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong> – Positioning:</strong> To achieve proper positioning, it’s
        crucial that you are very clear (and reach your audience in the same
        way) about what your value proposition is and what it entails. In short,
        it’s why the consumer should choose you and not the competition. You
        need to know how you’re going to communicate your unique value
        proposition and how to do so appropriately in the channels where your
        audience is present (social media, blogs, email marketing, and more). –
        Content strategy: This is important for creating, distributing, and
        managing original content that attracts users and positions the brand as
        referential in users’ top of mind. Besides, you also have to map out a
        specific communications plan (content marketing) for every channel. Some
        of the tools we use to execute this strategy are:
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>1. Keyword research:</strong>
        This involves identifying appropriate keywords for us to use correctly
        in our content to organically improve our SEO positioning. This is
        imperative for every content strategy if you want users to find you on
        search engines.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>2. Content calendar:</strong> A content calendar is key for
        ensuring your strategy makes sense. It provides value; it lets you think
        long-term and optimize your resources, help create ideas, and more. In a
        content calendar, you should include the date of publication, author,
        post topic, keyword, the tags to use/take into consideration, and so on.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>3. Social posting:</strong> Writing an article and not promoting
        it on social media is a mistake. It’s not spamming but instead planning
        out what you are going to publish and when on every social media
        platform with the copies best suited for each one, all while having the
        ideal number of characters, links, hashtags, and more.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3>4. Digital Strategies and Tactics</h3>
      <p>
        Today, considering that the number of channels to manage is multiplying
        and the amount of information we get about our customers is increasing,
        it’s critical we use Marketing Automation tools that let you automate
        your marketing campaigns. Thanks to these tactics, you’ll be able to
        create workflows that will allow you to create hundreds of campaigns
        with mere clicks. You’ll be able to personalize messages based on your
        buyer persona, increasing your chances for success; not only that,
        you’ll be able to take them, depending on their interactions with the
        brand, towards the moment of purchase. Technology has turned into a
        fundamental tool for implementing digital strategies, making it critical
        for you to learn to get the most out of it.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Measuring Results and KPIs</h3>
      <p>
        The work doesn’t stop after you’ve designed and implemented your digital
        marketing strategy. The next step is one of the most important:
        analyzing the results. Analytics has turned into a critical pillar for
        successfully optimizing digital marketing performance and spending. You
        have to measure every action using KPIs to figure out if you earned the
        ROI you expected. Measuring the effectiveness of the strategies and
        activities you implemented in your digital marketing will help you
        correct what doesn’t work to achieve the goals you set. Make sure you
        have an effective real-time data visualization system. The digital world
        evolves rapidly, so you need to be on the lookout at all times to
        identify opportunities and room for improvement in an instant. Keep
        these steps in mind when creating your digital marketing plan and don’t
        leave anything to chance; it’s your greatest enemy if you’re looking to
        position yourself and boost your presence in the digital space.
        Likewise, keep in mind that technology can turn into your greatest ally
        to create personalized, automated, and ultimately, successfully
        marketing campaigns. As the task gets complicated, the new tools out
        there let you simplify your work and boost your performance.
