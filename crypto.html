        <h1>The Future of Cryptocurrency</h1>
        <img src="images/bitcoin.jpg" height="300px" width="400px"> 
        <p>
            We live in a digital world, where many financial transactions are done digitally.
            Over the past few years, investors have particularly been celebrating this atmosphere,
            especially with the increase of investment options they can put their bucks in.
            In line with this, there’s a big chance you know a thing or two about cryptocurrencies,
            or you have at least heard of the term.
        </p>

        <h3>What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h3>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions. 
            Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability.
            The most important feature of a cryptocurrency is that it is not controlled by any central authority: 
            the decentralized nature of the blockchain makes cryptocurrencies theoretically immune to the old ways of government control 
            and interference.
            Cryptocurrencies can be sent directly between two parties via the use of private and public keys. 
             These transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by traditional
              financial institutions.
        </p>
        <h3>Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoin is probably the most well-known cryptocurrency but they come in many forms which include
Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. These are all types of digital or virtual currency collectively
known as cryptocurrencies.
However, the more established Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become in the future,
the more retailers and businesses will be willing to accept it as a legitimate currency. 
Bitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency, a form of digital asset or money that can be exchanged
in a similar way to normal currency. There’s no physical money attached to a cryptocurrency,
so there are no coins or notes, only a digital record of the transaction.
This digital record is often referred to as a blockchain.
A blockchain is a historical record of each transaction verified by each computer in the network.
The verification is done after every transaction, for example when a cryptocurrency was sold and
which account was credited. Each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain.
Cryptocurrencies are only a digital representation of value which isn’t issued or guaranteed
by a central bank or public authority.
        </p>
        <h3>How are cryptocurrencies made?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are created through a process called mining.
            Mining involves teams of computers solving mathematical problems. When the problem is solved,
            tokens for whichever cryptocurrency was being worked on are created, for example a bitcoin,
            and the computer that got the solution gets the new token.
            Mining is also what gives cryptocurrencies their security.
            The mathematical problems that are being solved are connected to the blockchain,
            the record of every single token in a cryptocurrency.
            The latest mathematical problem doesn’t just create more tokens, it also checks the latest transactions
            at the same time.

        <h3>
Could cryptocurrency be the future of investing?
        </h3>
<p>Now, due to the ever-increasing popularity of this virtual currency crypto is all the rage among investors nowadays. For more than just a few reasons, expert predictions have it that crypto is here to stay.
     Without further ado, here are some why cryptocurrencies are the future of investment.
     <br>
     <br>
    <strong> 1. The Returns Are Incredible </strong>
    <br>
For the short period they have been around, cryptocurrencies have proven to be among the most profitable investment options out there. 
Compared to stocks, whose highest returns average at around 20% in the US, returns from cryptocurrency can go well above 100%. 
Despite being a high-risk investment since huge profits are never a sure-bet, many people out there are willing to risk big for
 massive gains. However, massive losses are also a possibility for those who trade crypto without a winning strategy in place.  
<br>
<br>
 <strong>2. Innovation Potential</strong>
 <br>
High volatility is a major characteristic of cryptocurrency trading. 
In other words, prices can change massively in a fraction of a second. But this also creates an opportunity for huge profits, 
thus keeping innovative minds busy trying to find technological solutions around the main issue.
Many crypto trading tools and online platforms are trying to use AI and machine learning tech to help their traders
 take advantage of this gap. Just like in stock trading, we will soon have many cryptocurrency advisor tools and services
  providing insights and forecasts to crypto investors.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Free From Government Interference </strong>
<br>
The other benefit of cryptocurrencies is that they are not regulated by governments as national currencies are. 
As anyone would guess, this independence has prompted more and more people to invest in cryptocurrency for a good reason.
 It gives everyone around the globe a chance to invest, even those whose national currencies have badly depreciated in the
  name of international sanctions and other factors. In addition to user anonymity, cryptocurrencies can easily be converted 
  from a wide range of different currencies. Moving funds overseas is easier and safer when using crypto, which makes it a great
   alternative to all regardless of race, color, or country of origin.
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>4. The Liquidity Is High</strong>
   <br> 
Last but not least, cryptocurrencies are characterized by high liquidity. In other words, it is quite easy 
and quick to buy and sell crypto whenever you want. Auto-trading is also an available option in some trading organizations,
 making the process even more convenient. You can make money in your sleep!
Cryptocurrency is beyond reasonable doubt here to stay. It pretty much could be the future of investment 
for many years to come. If the above reasons are not convincing enough, then what is?
