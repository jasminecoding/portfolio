          <h2><strong>BARK MOBILE</strong></h2>
          <p>
            For a lot of people, typical wireless service isn't an option.
            Either they can't get it because of credit issues, or they can't
            afford it, or they hate contracts. Or all three. For them, Bark
            Mobile is a great option.
            <br />
            <strong>Teaser outdoor.</strong> Before the service launched, we
            created a teaser campaign that hinted at what was to come: a service
            with no contracts, no minute limits, and no shockingly big bills.
            <br />
            <strong> Website.</strong> Once the service launched, so did the
            website. Simple, easy to navigate, and kinda purty.
            <br />
            <strong> Radio. </strong>We went with humor. People seem to like
            humor.

          <h2><strong>STREAKS APP</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Why do people get discouraged about their health and fitness?
            Because they've tried and failed too many times. Or they don't have
            time to go to the gym. Or they don't know where to even start.
            <br />

            Meeting people where they are is the idea behind Streaks for Small
            Starts. It's a health and fitness app designed to help people get
            started by taking the tiniest healthy steps.
            <br />
            <br />Drinking a little more water every day. <br />
            <br />
            Taking the stairs instead of the elevator. <br />
            <br />
            Adding just one serving of fruit to their daily meals.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ridiculously small steps like these are so easy anyone can do them.
            And once they start a streak of success, it helps them stay
            motivated to keep going. By using Streaks, they can get daily
            reminders and high-fives from other people using the app, too. Add
            all these small steps up, and over time they lead to big health
            changes.

          <h2><strong>MILLSTONE COFFEE</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Millstone is an affordably priced premium coffee sold in grocery
            stores all over the nation. But (there's that dreaded word) because
            of its boring, easy-to-miss packaging, many shoppers perceived it as
            a generic store brand.
            <br />
            <br />
            Millstone needed a rebrand. Badly. <br />
            <br />
            So once a new package design was created, we went to work on the
            digital space. With its new website, we helped change the perception
            of the brand into a premium-yet-approachable coffee dedicated to
            those who appreciate the process of a finely crafted cup of coffee.
            <br />
            <br />
            It starts with a rich, premium feel to the design. Then, a full
            story detailing the origins of Millstone's Arabica beans and the
            care their master roasters take in crafting them. Short, helpful
            how-to videos feature a light yet sophisticated tone. Product pages
            are written with SEO in mind. And recipe pages are easy to follow.
            Of course, we carried the new look and tone across Millstone's
            entire social presence, too.
