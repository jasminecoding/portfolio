            We live in a digital world, where many financial transactions are
            done digitally. Over the past few years, investors have particularly
            been celebrating this atmosphere, especially with the increase of
            investment options they can put their bucks in. In line with this,
            there’s a big chance you know a thing or two about cryptocurrencies,
            or you have at least heard of the term.
          </p>

          <h2>What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses
            cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions.
            Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain
            decentralization, transparency, and immutability. The most important
            feature of a cryptocurrency is that it is not controlled by any
            central authority: the decentralized nature of the blockchain makes
            cryptocurrencies theoretically immune to the old ways of government
            control and interference. Cryptocurrencies can be sent directly
            between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These
            transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users
            to avoid the steep fees charged by traditional financial
            institutions.
          </p>
          <h2>Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies</h2>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is probably the most well-known cryptocurrency but they come
            in many forms which include Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Bitcoin
            Cash. These are all types of digital or virtual currency
            collectively known as cryptocurrencies. However, the more
            established Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become in the future,
            the more retailers and businesses will be willing to accept it as a
            legitimate currency. Bitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency, a
            form of digital asset or money that can be exchanged in a similar
            way to normal currency. There’s no physical money attached to a
            cryptocurrency, so there are no coins or notes, only a digital
            record of the transaction. This digital record is often referred to
            as a blockchain. A blockchain is a historical record of each
            transaction verified by each computer in the network. The
            verification is done after every transaction, for example when a
            cryptocurrency was sold and which account was credited. Each
            cryptocurrency has its own blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are only a
            digital representation of value which isn’t issued or guaranteed by
            a central bank or public authority.
          </p>
          <h2>How are cryptocurrencies made?</h2>
          <p>
            Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are created through a process called
            mining. Mining involves teams of computers solving mathematical
            problems. When the problem is solved, tokens for whichever
            cryptocurrency was being worked on are created, for example a
            bitcoin, and the computer that got the solution gets the new token.
            Mining is also what gives cryptocurrencies their security. The
            mathematical problems that are being solved are connected to the
            blockchain, the record of every single token in a cryptocurrency.
            The latest mathematical problem doesn’t just create more tokens, it
            also checks the latest transactions at the same time.
          </p>
          <h2>Could cryptocurrency be the future of investing?</h2>
          <p>
            Now, due to the ever-increasing popularity of this virtual currency
            crypto is all the rage among investors nowadays. For more than just
            a few reasons, expert predictions have it that crypto is here to
            stay. Without further ado, here are some why cryptocurrencies are
            the future of investment.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong> 1. The Returns Are Incredible </strong>
            <br />
            For the short period they have been around, cryptocurrencies have
            proven to be among the most profitable investment options out there.
            Compared to stocks, whose highest returns average at around 20% in
            the US, returns from cryptocurrency can go well above 100%. Despite
            being a high-risk investment since huge profits are never a
            sure-bet, many people out there are willing to risk big for massive
            gains. However, massive losses are also a possibility for those who
            trade crypto without a winning strategy in place.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>2. Innovation Potential</strong>
            <br />
            High volatility is a major characteristic of cryptocurrency trading.
            In other words, prices can change massively in a fraction of a
            second. But this also creates an opportunity for huge profits, thus
            keeping innovative minds busy trying to find technological solutions
            around the main issue. Many crypto trading tools and online
            platforms are trying to use AI and machine learning tech to help
            their traders take advantage of this gap. Just like in stock
            trading, we will soon have many cryptocurrency advisor tools and
            services providing insights and forecasts to crypto investors.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>3. Free From Government Interference </strong>
            <br />
            The other benefit of cryptocurrencies is that they are not regulated
            by governments as national currencies are. As anyone would guess,
            this independence has prompted more and more people to invest in
            cryptocurrency for a good reason. It gives everyone around the globe
            a chance to invest, even those whose national currencies have badly
            depreciated in the name of international sanctions and other
            factors. In addition to user anonymity, cryptocurrencies can easily
            be converted from a wide range of different currencies. Moving funds
            overseas is easier and safer when using crypto, which makes it a
            great alternative to all regardless of race, color, or country of
            origin.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>4. The Liquidity Is High</strong>
            <br />
            Last but not least, cryptocurrencies are characterized by high
            liquidity. In other words, it is quite easy and quick to buy and
            sell crypto whenever you want. Auto-trading is also an available
            option in some trading organizations, making the process even more
            convenient. You can make money in your sleep! Cryptocurrency is
            beyond reasonable doubt here to stay. It pretty much could be the
            future of investment for many years to come. If the above reasons
            are not convincing enough, then what is?
